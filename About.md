# Company Database

This database is very similar to a real life company database. It contains entities like EMPLOYEES, PROJECTS, WORKS_ON, LOCATION and DEPARTMENT. The idea is to create a database similar to real life so that we can perform functions like creating, updating and manipulating database to get an understanding of the concept.
